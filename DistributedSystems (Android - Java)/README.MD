<h2> Distributed Systems </h2>

In this lesson, we had to create a clone of Spotify in a smaller scale. Back-End is built with Java and Front-End with Android of course. Publisher-Broker-Consumer architecture was a must for this project. The Application uses 2 Publishers and 2 Brokers. Sockets and Threads were used, as well.
