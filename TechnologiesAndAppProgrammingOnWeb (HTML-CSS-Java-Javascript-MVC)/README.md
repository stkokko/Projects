<h2>TechnologiesAndAppProgrammingOnWeb</h2>

On this assigment we had to create a full stack web application using MVC architecture to achieve it. As far as Font-End is concerned we made use of both HTML and CSS and then for the Back-End
Javascript was a must. See, we had to implement many trigger events as well as to retrieve data from the database. Ofcourse, Java could not be absent from
this project using Spring Boot.
