<h2>TechnologiesAndAppProgrammingOnWeb</h2>

On this assigment we had to create a full stack web application using MVC architecture to achieve it. As far as Font-End is concerned, we made use both of HTML5 and CSS. For the Back-End Javascript was a must. See, we had to implement many trigger events as well as to retrieve data from the Database (Tomcat), except from the necessary calls to API service. Ofcourse, Java could not be absent from this project using Spring MVC.
