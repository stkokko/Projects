<h2> Data Structures </h2>

The goal of this lesson was to become familiar with the basics data structures such as FIFO queues, priority queues, binary search trees and randomized binary search
trees. In order to learn how they work we had to implement 3 projects. The first one had to do with FIFO queues, the second one with priority queues and the third one
with binary search tree and randomized binary search trees.
