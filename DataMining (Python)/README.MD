<h2> Data Mining </h2>

In this lesson we had to predict the number of bikes that a company should rent on each place. In order to achieve better accuracy we used many different models and 
so algorithms. At start, we had to read our data, make some checks (null values etc) and edit the types of our features to make sure we get the best of our training
models and so better accuracy. Second step, and a really important one, was to remove the "unwanted" outliers to minimize the deviation. Below, it's the algorithms we
used in every model:

* Model 1: Linear Regression
* Model 2: Linear Regression with modified data
* Model 3: Random Forest
* Model 4: Gradient Boost
* Model 5: Neural Network
