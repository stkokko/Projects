<h2> Computer Programming </h2>

In this lesson we had to implement 2 projects. The second one it's an expansion of the first one. The goal was to create a program which had to do with a 
mobile communications company and all the services it provides. Below are all the requirements the program should have:

* Initialize the list of provided services and the available contracts list
* Create a new contract
* Show the active contracts for a specific type of service
* Updating usage statistics of a contract
* Calculating the total monthly cost not only for the telephony program contracts but for the mobile internet service too and the monthly balance available for card contracts
* Calculating the remaining talk time and the free sms for the telephony program contracts and the free data balance for internet services
