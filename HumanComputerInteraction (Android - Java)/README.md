<h2> Human - Computer Interaction</h2>

In this lesson, every group had the freedom to choose what kind of android app they'd like to develop. So, we developed SmartCook. SmartCook is an android app for appliances, friendly to people with disabilities as it provides voice commands. You can take a look of what UI looks like here [AppPresentation](https://github.com/stkokko/Projects/blob/master/HumanComputerInteraction%20(Android%20-%20Java)/AppPresentation.pdf).
